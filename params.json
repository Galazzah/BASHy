{"name":"BASHy","tagline":"a BASH script package manager for everyone","body":"### BASHy.\r\nLove BASH scripting? Love people who script with BASH? Don't love sharing and versioning your scripts with people who love to script with BASH? BASHy creates a layer of abstraction to make your life easier.\r\n\r\n### Self hosted with Google Spreadsheets as a database\r\nUsing a server based database to store, maintain, and download packages would be a hassle. With BASHy, simply upload your script to a git repository and add an entry to your Spreadsheet!\r\n\r\n### Channels for you, and me, and everyone\r\nBASHy leverages the idea of Channels, or community databases (hosted on Google drive) to share your BASH scripts with your friends. Simply grab the URL of a Channel you would like to join, and you're ready to go! Add as many Channels as you'd like!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated for HackUCI 2015 by Ghiyath Alazzah (@galazzah), Maxime Zaccarin (@maxzac1289), Ali Shahbaz (@alishahbaz111), Haseeb Hassan (@hassquared, and Huda Herwees (@hherwees).\r\n\r\n### Technology \r\nBASHy leverages BASH (of course), Python, Git, the Google Visualization API, and Google Drive.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
